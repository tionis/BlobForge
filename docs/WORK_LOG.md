- **Objective:** Add S3 namespacing support and establish agent protocols.
- **Actions:**
    - Modified `config.py` to include `S3_PREFIX`.
    - Updated `janitor.py`, `status.py`, and `ingestor.py` to use standardized config paths.
    - Verified prefixing logic with a dry-run test.
    - Created `AGENTS.md`, `TODO.md`, and `docs/WORK_LOG.md` to define repository standards for AI agents.
- **Status:** Namespacing complete. Agent environment initialized.
